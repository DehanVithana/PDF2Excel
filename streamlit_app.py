    ### About the App
    This application uses `tabula-py` and `pandas` to extract tabular data from your PDFs.
    It works best on documents with clear table structures but can also make a good guess on less structured data.
    
    You can deploy this application on Streamlit's Community Cloud by simply pushing this script to a GitHub repository.
